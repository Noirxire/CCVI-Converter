What actually IS a .CCVI file?

i'm glad you asked, text file that can't speak.
A .CCVI file, or a Compressed Colour Vector Image, is an image
compressed by changing every colour into a series of PLANES,
which contain RGB Values, VECTORS, which contain Saturation,
Height, and Transparency values, and lastly nothing else,
because i didn't add any more things.

It's ridiculously innefficient, but it's funny nontheless.
